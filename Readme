# **Bellabeat Smart Device Analysis – Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**

## **Overview**

This case study analyzes **Bellabeat smart device usage** to understand user behavior, activity patterns, and sleep habits. The objective is to derive **data-driven marketing insights** that can enhance **customer engagement and growth**. The analysis follows a structured approach using **R for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical modeling**.

## **Project Details**

- **Company:** Bellabeat – a wellness tech company for women
- **Role:** Junior Data Analyst, Marketing Analytics Team
- **Objective:** Analyze smart device usage data to uncover trends and provide strategic marketing recommendations for Bellabeat.

## **Scenario**

Bellabeat is a **small but growing tech company** that produces **women’s health-focused wearable devices**, including:
- **Leaf (Wearable Tracker)** – Tracks activity, sleep, and stress.
- **Time (Wellness Watch)** – Smartwatch-style fitness tracker.
- **Spring (Smart Water Bottle)** – Monitors hydration levels.
- **Bellabeat App** – Connects to all devices and provides insights.

The **goal** is to analyze **user activity data from non-Bellabeat devices (Fitbit dataset)** to identify trends and **optimize Bellabeat’s marketing strategies**.

## **Research Questions (ASK Phase)**

1. What trends exist in smart device usage?
2. How do these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How can these insights influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy?

## **Dataset & Limitations**

### **Dataset Used:** Fitbit Fitness Tracker Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Timeframe:** 31 days (March–April 2016)
- **Sample Size:** 30 Fitbit users
- **Data Points Tracked:**
  - **Daily activity metrics** – Steps, active minutes, calories burned
  - **Sleep data** – Duration, efficiency, patterns
  - **Hourly movement data** – Steps, calories, and intensity

### **Limitations**
- **Small sample size (30 users)** – Limited generalizability.
- **Lack of demographic data** – No gender, age, or location details.
- **Short data collection period (31 days)** – No seasonal trend insights.

---

## **Methodology (PROCESS Phase)**

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Removed **duplicates and missing values**.
- Standardized **date/time formats**.
- Renamed columns for **consistency**.
- Merged datasets to create **daily_activity_steps dataset**.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Summary statistics** on user behavior.
- **Visualizations** (scatter plots, bar charts, histograms).
- **Correlation analysis** to find relationships between:
  - **Activity levels & calorie burn**
  - **Step counts & sedentary behavior**
  - **Sleep duration & movement**

### **3. Statistical Modeling**
- **Calculated correlations** between:
  - Very active minutes and calories burned (**strong correlation: 0.62**)
  - Total steps and calories burned (**moderate correlation: 0.37**)
  - Sedentary minutes and steps (**negative correlation: -0.26**)

---

## **Key Insights & Findings**

### **1. Activity Trends**
- **Most users are sedentary:** Average **991 minutes/day (16.5 hours)**.
- **Average steps per day:** **7,638 steps** (meets the 7,500 daily step recommendation).
- **Peak active hours:** **5 PM – 7 PM** (post-work exercise).
- **Users with higher total steps tend to engage in more intense activity.**

### **2. Sleep Patterns**
- **Average sleep duration:** **~7 hours**, slightly below the recommended **8 hours**.
- **Some users have sleep deficits** (minimum recorded: **58 minutes**).
- **Weekends (Saturday & Sunday) have lower step counts**, potentially due to **rest days.**

### **3. Calories Burned**
- **Higher steps = higher calories burned**, but only at high-intensity activity.
- **Light activity (walking) contributes little to calorie burn.**
- **Most calories are burned in the evening (5 PM – 8 PM).**

## **Marketing Recommendations for Bellabeat**

1. **Encourage More Activity**
   - Create **step challenges** and **active reminders** via the Bellabeat app.
   - Use **push notifications** in peak hours (**5 PM – 7 PM**) to motivate workouts.

2. **Promote Sleep & Recovery**
   - Market **Bellabeat sleep tracking** as a **feature for better wellness**.
   - Provide **personalized sleep recommendations** via the Bellabeat app.

3. **Hydration & Wellness Education**
   - Promote the **Spring smart water bottle** as a hydration coach.
   - Educate users on **the impact of hydration on energy and calorie burn**.

4. **Optimize Digital Marketing**
   - Focus on **social media ads** targeting **evening fitness users**.
   - Create **content around the benefits of high-intensity exercise**.

## **How to Use This Analysis**

### **Prerequisites**
- Install **R and RStudio**.
- Install required R packages:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "janitor", "skimr"))
  ```

### **Run Data Cleaning & Analysis**
1. Load data:
   ```r
   daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
   ```
2. Clean & preprocess:
   ```r
   daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
      distinct() %>%
      drop_na() %>%
      rename_with(tolower)
   ```
3. Visualize trends:
   ```r
   ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x = totalsteps, y = calories)) +
      geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
   ```
